This is an escape room mini-game made in Unreal Engine. Your goal is to leave the room. The game is short and simple, since it was created for the purposes of learning Unreal Engine and C++ in Unreal.

The repository contains only essential files that can’t be generated by the engine. The game uses Starter Content Pack, which is not included in the repository, but has to be added to the project.
The version of Unreal that I used is 4.18.3.

**Controls**:
- *WASD* – movement
- Hold *left shift* or *right mouse button* to grab and move objects.
